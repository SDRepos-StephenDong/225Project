### Objectives
Observation of the trend and distribution of EV ownership to gain some insights and predictions that may benefit automakers plan their manufacturing and sales.
1. What does the trend of EV ownership look like in Washington?
2. Does our trend match what we expect or currently accept given general observations?
3. How is EV ownership distributed throughout Washington?
4. How can we predict the EV population in WA for the next few years?
